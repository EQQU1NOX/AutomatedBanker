# AutomatedBanker

Java program that automates the personal banking role. The system will be able to take teller transactions, open accounts, and gather info. 

Coming from the retail banking industry, this was the first project I wanted to create. I understand the ins and outs of a bank teller program and what can be improved upon in the world of retail banking.

This program is very basic and is meant to be use the most efficient code possible. I will consider adding different elements to the program over time and making it a functional AI banker but for the meantime it is meant to be the foundation of a simple bank teller software.
